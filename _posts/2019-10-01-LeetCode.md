## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
### Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
```
Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length-1;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while(start<end){
            int mid = (start+end)/2;
            if(nums[mid]<nums[end]){
                end = mid;
            }else if(nums[mid]>nums[end]){
                //need to add one otherwise will loop forever.
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```

## 207. Course Schedule
### Description
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
```
Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

### Solution
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Queue;
import javax.imageio.ImageTranscoder;

class Solution {
	//main idea is topological sort.
	public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
		int[][] graph = new int[numCourses][numCourses];
		int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];

		for(int i=0;i<prerequisites.length;i++){
			int cur = prerequisites[i][0];
			int pre = prerequisites[i][1];
			//to prevent duplication.
			if(graph[pre][cur]==0){
				inDegree[cur]++;
			}
			graph[pre][cur] = 1;

		}

		int count = 0;
		Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
		for(int i =0;i<numCourses;i++){
			if(inDegree[i]==0){
				queue.offer(i);
			}
		}

		while (!queue.isEmpty()){
			int course = queue.poll();
			count++;
			for(int i = 0;i<numCourses;i++){
				if(graph[course][i]!=0){
					if(--inDegree[i]==0){
						queue.offer(i);
					}
				}
			}

		}
		return count == numCourses;
	}
}
```

## 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

```

Example:

Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
```

### SOlution
```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _prev,Node _next,Node _child) {
        val = _val;
        prev = _prev;
        next = _next;
        child = _child;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {

	public Node flatten(Node head) {
		if(head == null){
			return head;
		}
		Node temp = head;
		while(temp!=null){
			if(temp.child == null){
				temp = temp.next;
				continue;
			}
			Node c = flatten(temp.child);
			Node tempNx = temp.next;
			temp.next = c;
			c.prev = temp;
			while(c.next!=null){
				c = c.next;
			}
			c.next = tempNx;
			if(tempNx!=null){
				tempNx.prev = c;
			}
            temp.child = null;
			temp = tempNx;
		}
		return head;
	}
```
