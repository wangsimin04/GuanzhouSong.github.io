## 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence
### Description
Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

Return true if there exists i, j, k
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
```
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
```

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
	// start with two largest values, as soon as we find a number bigger than both, while both have been updated, return true.
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        int small = Integer.MAX_VALUE, large = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n <= small) {
            	// update small if n is smaller than both
                small = n;
            } else if (n <= large) {
            	// update big only if greater than small but smaller than big
                large = n;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```
