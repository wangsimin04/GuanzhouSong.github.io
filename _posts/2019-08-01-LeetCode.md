## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### Desc
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
```
Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for(int price : prices){
            minPrice = Math.min(price,minPrice);
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,price - minPrice);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
### Desc
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
```
Example 1:

Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        return helper(prices, 0 , 0 ,new HashMap<String,Integer>());
    }
    
    private int helper(int[] prices, int index, int transaction, Map<String,Integer> memo){
        String param = index + "-" + transaction;
        
        if(memo.containsKey(param)){
            return memo.get(param);
        }
        if(index ==prices.length || transaction > 3){
        	//make sure the transaction is less than 2: buy/sell for 4 times.
            memo.put(param,0);
            return memo.get(param);
        }
        int c1 = 0, c2 = 0;
        if(transaction % 2== 0){
            c1 = helper(prices,index+1, transaction + 1, memo) - prices[index]; //buy
            c2 = helper(prices, index+1, transaction , memo); // skip
        }else{
            c1 = helper(prices, index+1 , transaction+1, memo) + prices[index]; //sell
            c2 = helper(prices, index+1, transaction , memo); //skip
        }
        memo.put(param, Math.max(c1,c2));
        return memo.get(param);
    }
}

```

## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
### Desc
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
```
Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```
### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length;
        if (k >= len / 2) return quickSolve(prices);
        
        int[][] t = new int[k + 1][len];
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            int tmpMax =  -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < len; j++) {
                t[i][j] = Math.max(t[i][j - 1], prices[j] + tmpMax);
                tmpMax =  Math.max(tmpMax, t[i - 1][j - 1] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        return t[k][len - 1];
    }
    

    private int quickSolve(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length, profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++)
            // as long as there is a price gap, we gain a profit.
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        return profit;
    }
}

```
